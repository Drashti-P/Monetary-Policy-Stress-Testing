Understanding the impact of endogenous economic variables on the Base Interest Rate

Developed a VAR and SVAR model to obtain the Forecast Variance Decomposition and Impulse Response Function plots to understand how the U.K. Base Interest Rate reacts to GDP, Inflation, and UK-US exchange rate shocks.

Data: Monthly data of Base Interest Rates, GDP Index Values, annual CPI rates, and UK-US exchange rates from the Bank of England and ONS, covering the period from 1997 to 2023.

Main Features: Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical tests, and mathematical transformations to obtain stationarity, model development ( will later upload Python code of variable ordering with Cholesky Matrix), Forecast Variance Decomposition, and Impulse Response Function plots.

The Impulse Response Functions are the most significant as the show the shock of one macroeconomic factor on the other and the following converge to the norm.

This is the first econometrics project I've independently completed, as a way to learn R and further my knowledge of Time Series Modelling, so I am open to any and all feedback and further ideas!

## The uploaded code will be adjusted soon with comments explaining the code and flow of work.##
