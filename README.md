Understanding the impact of endogenous economic variables on the Base Interest Rate

Developed a VAR and SVAR model to obtain the Forecast Variance Decomposition and Impulse Response Function plots to understand how the U.K. Base Interest Rate reacts to GDP, Inflation, and UK-US exchange rate shocks.

Data: Monthly data of Base Interest Rates, GDP Index Values, annual CPI rates, and UK-US exchange rates from the Bank of England and ONS, covering the period from 1997 to 2023.

Main Features: Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical tests, and mathematical transformations to obtain stationarity, model development ( will later upload Python code of variable ordering with Cholesky Matrix), Forecast Variance Decomposition, and Impulse Response Function plots.

_The Impulse Response Functions are the most significant as the show the shock of one macroeconomic factor on the other and the following converge to the norm._

This is the first econometrics project I've independently completed, as a way to learn R and further my knowledge of Time Series Modelling, so I am open to any and all feedback and further ideas!

###The uploaded code will be adjusted soon with comments explaining the code and flow of work.
